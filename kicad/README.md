KiCad placeholders for Robot Vacuum PCB project

This folder contains placeholder files for the KiCad project: a human-readable schematic placeholder, a minimal PCB placeholder, and a starter BOM. These are rough draft files created to capture the structure for a simple board that hosts an Arduino Nano v3, two DC drive motors (via VNH5019), a MOSFET-switched vacuum fan, a 5V buck regulator, battery input, and a few sensor/servo connectors. This is intentionally minimal — a starting point for layout and iterative design.

Files:
- schematic_placeholder.sch — human-readable schematic netlist and notes
- pcb_placeholder.kicad_pcb — simplified PCB outline and mounting hole placeholders
- robot_vacuum_pcb_bom.csv — initial parts list with suggested parts

Next: I will replace these placeholders with an actual KiCad schematic (.sch) and PCB (.kicad_pcb) when you confirm to proceed. For now these capture the connections and parts used in the rough draft.
