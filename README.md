# Robot Vacuum DIY

A DIY robot vacuum project

## 🚀 Overview

This project guides you through the creation of a robot vacuum using off-the-shelf parts and open-source electronics. You'll learn to wire motors, design the chassis, program navigation logic, and integrate smart features.

## Features

- Autonomous navigation
- Obstacle avoidance
- Cleaning pattern algorithms
- Expandable hardware platform
- Open-source firmware
- Step-by-step build instructions

## 🛠️ Hardware

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi)
- Motor drivers
- DC motors and wheels
- Vacuum motor + dustbin
- Bumper sensors, IR/Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection
- Chassis (can be 3D printed or hand-built)
- Battery and power management

## 💡 Software

- Firmware for basic movement and cleaning logic
- Sensor integration for navigation
- Expansion hooks for WiFi/app control
